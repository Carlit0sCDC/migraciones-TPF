Footnotes:
1,"Source: Labour Force Survey (LFS)."
2,"The unemployment rate is based on a monthly average from January to December."
3,"Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for Canada are derived using LFS results from the provinces. LFS results for the territories are not included in the national estimates."
4,"Adjustments are made to Labour Force Survey (LFS) data every five years after new population estimates become available following the most recent census. At that time, all LFS data back to the previous census is re-weighted using the new population estimates (since the new population estimates will cover the inter-censal period between the two most recent censuses), and all corresponding historical LFS estimates are revised. Therefore, at the beginning of 2021, all estimates were adjusted to reflect 2016 Census population counts and LFS estimates have been revised back to January 2006."
5,"Most of the estimates contained in this table have been assigned a letter to indicate their coefficient of variation (c.v.) (expressed as a percentage). The letter grades represent the following coefficients of variation: A is used for a c.v. between or equal to 0.00% and 5.00% and means Excellent, B is used for a c.v. between or equal to 5.01% and 15.00% and means Very good, C is used for a c.v. between or equal to 15.01% and 25.00% and means Good, D is used for a c.v. between or equal to 25.01% and 35.00% and means Acceptable, E is used for a c.v. greater than 35.00% and means Use with caution."
6,"Caution should be exercised in interpreting the provincial/territorial ratios and differences in ratios between provinces/territories and over time, as small estimates may present fairly high sampling variability. Estimates for small geographic areas, for small age-groups or for cross-classified variables will be associated with larger variability."
7,"Includes no education or education below high school graduation."
8,"Includes high school graduation or some postsecondary education (not completed)."
9,"Includes trade certificate or diploma from a vocational school or apprenticeship training; non-university certificate or diploma from a community college, CEGEP, school of nursing and similar programs at this level; and university certificate below bachelor's level."
10,"Includes bachelor's degree and university degree or certificate above bachelor's degree."
